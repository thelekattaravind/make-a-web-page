		<h2>Lesson 1</h2>
		<div class="info">
			<p>HTML-hyper text markup language, text content is what you see on the internet and markup is how it looks</p>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>How the web works-Your browser on your computer makes HTTP requests which are sent to servers which send
			back HTML documents to be seen on your browser
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>Elements-What HTML document are made of</p>
			<p>Tags-what is used to manipulate elements, example: < b > < /b >-this is the bold tag it needs both an opening 
			and closing tag around the section of text you want to highlight like <b>THIS</b> but this is not true for all tags
			example: < br > this produces a line break like the ones you see throughout this HTML document
			</p>	
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>Inline Tags-the two last discussed tags are called inline tags because they occur in line and are different from
			"cousin" Block tags
			</p>
			<p>Block tags- are tags that create a block around what ever is effected by the tag making that area separate from
			the rest of the area 
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>Finally remember computers are stupid they need to be told what to do and that can only happen when you tell
			them what to do for example if you don't close a tag the computer will <b>make all of the following text bold
			so remember it is you who needs to write the instructions</b>
			</p>	
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="lesson">
		<h2>Lesson 2</h2>
		<div class="info">
			<p>Developer tools- as we discussed in the last lesson there are tags that create boxes around the info you put between the tags.  These tools allow you to see the boxes and the properties within the boxes and even the styles that apply to the box.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>Structure of HTML- When looking at the bare text of a HTML document you will see a distinct tree-like structure sort of like a genealogy tree where there nested boxes which contain the next generation of family members.  The more ideated the box is within the text the deeper nested that box is within its corresponding box.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="info">
			<p>Text Editors-  Meant to make a programmers life easier by providing shortcuts such as automatically providing a closing tag to help the programmer speed along especially considering how much a programmer has to type.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="lesson">
		<h2>Lesson 3</h2>
		<div class="info">
			<p>Avoiding repetition- By not repeating the same process over and over again you can <em>avoid making errors.</em> How so?  Simply because if you have to make any changes then you will not have to repeat the same process over and over again by chance missing one fix.  <em>Consistency</em> is key because it allow you to define a kind of item and allows you to apply the same process to several objects that are of the same kind.
			</p>
			<p>CSS-   Cascading Style Sheets is similar to what was said about consistency CSS allows us to group similar HTML elements under the same class and apply a style to all elements that fall under the same class.</p>
